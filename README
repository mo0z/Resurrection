19:42 <jercos> vendu: inverted colors doesn't seem to change background to
+foreground, only foreground to background

I'd like you to start by trying these steps (most of the following is either
irrelevant or potentially out of date)

----8<----

./configure
make
make install
Rterm
(in the terminal)
export TERM=vt100 or export TERM=xterm
export LC_ALL="en_US.ISO8859-1" (until UTF-8 support works)

try something such as your IRC client; irssi has revealed quite a bunch of bugs.

NOTES
-----
- You need X, a Unix-like OS, Imlib2 (version with header files, some Linux
  distributions call it devel), as well as libXext installed to compile and run
  Resurrection.
- It's early software, development version, so it's likely to have bugs. :) Good
  luck. :P

Rwm may be of some use, your mileage may vary.

Have fun,

/* vendu */

P.S. Comments would be welcome at resurrection.fin AT gmail DOT com.

----8<----

Start by editing RESURRECTION_SHARE_PATH in include/Resurrection/setup.h.

RTERM
-----

- currently, Rterm should be run with double buffering on (the -X command line
  option); this helps avoid some scroll bugs

COMMANDS
--------
- Ctrl + Shift + keypad digits; input numeric character value, Ctrl + Shift +
  Enter accepts
- Ctrl-Shift-n - create new tab
- Ctrl-Shift-x - close current tab
- Ctrl-Tab, Ctrl-Up - move to next tab/screen
- Ctrl-Backspace, Ctrl-Down - move to previous tab/screen

FEATURES
--------
- supports a subset of VT100 control sequences (should be pretty useful already)
- early support for UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters (16-bit)
- early support for Truetype scalable fonts [that are rendered as if monospace]
- supports 256 terminal colors xterm-style
- can spawn login and non-login shells on pseudo-teletype devices
- supports blinking cursor; this used to be rare back at the day
- supports blinking characters, although i'm not sure if they work at the moment
- when double-buffering is enabled, allows use of background images (currently
  hardwired). See SUPPORT_RTERM_SCREEN_DOUBLE_BUFFER in
  include/Resurrection/term.h. Note that this may cause problems with XShm.

NEWS
----

- adds tab support; see SUPPORT_RTERM_TABS in include/Resurrection/term.h.
- fixes some tab bugs like colors that were wrong in 0.0.8
- blinking cursor is drawn better / more reliably now
- most command line editing related bugs should be history; these were mostly
  also present in rxvt and many of its forks.

RWM
---

- it's good practice to run a terminal as last command in your
  .xinitrc/.xsession and then launch Rwm by hand from it. This way, a crashing
  window manager will not take all your accounts down (when it runs as a session
  manager, whose termination ends the X session)
- XMMS playlist window doesn't work correctly; something to do with at least
  ConfigureRequest events
- window border button bindings are as follows; TODO: FIX THOSE THAT DON'T WORK
  - left button hold on top and left borders	- move window
  - right button on any border			- move window
  - left button hold on bottom border		- resize window vertically
  - left button hold on right border		- resize window horizontally
  - ctrl + left button 	      			- shade (show only titlebar)
  - shift + left button on top border (title)	- close window
  - the following do NOT work yet
  - shift + right button on top border (title)	- kill window
  - shift + F1..F4     - switch between desktops 1-4
  - ctrl + F1	       - launch terminal
  - ctrl + F2	       - launch editor
  - ctrl + F3	       - launch browser
  - ctrl + F4	       - launch audio player
  - ctrl + F5	       - launch instant messenger


DISTRIBUTION
------------

resurrection-beta-0.0.29.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- worked on Rl; try Ctrl + click on the terminal button to open terminal tabs
  which are only visible when you access them through the launcher terminal bar

resurrection-beta-0.0.28.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- xmms crashes Rwm; audacious would seem to work
- Rl has new commands and tooltips

resurrection-beta-0.0.27.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- Rwm seems relatively useful and stable now, although might crash on occasion
- new application, Rl, to demonstrate programming using the toolkit + other
  goodies; a simple application launcher
- fixed more bugs here and there

resurrection-beta-0.0.26.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- fixed a bunch of mistakes I made when hacking in tabs support; for example,
  control sequences and tab redraws should work better now (not perfectly yet)

resurrection-beta-0.0.24.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- fixed some signal hassle; I hope the terminal won't hang any longer :)

resurrection-beta-0.0.23.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- added input of numeric character values as suggested by jercos

resurrection-beta-0.0.21.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- added mousewheel support; wheel + Ctrl scrolls 5 pages, wheel + Shift scrolls
  1 line, wheel scrolls 1 page at a time
- added handling of a couple of missing xterm control sequences; TERM=xterm
  should be reasonably good now

resurrection-beta-0.0.19.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- fixed lagginess
- added support for Truetype scalable fonts; it's the default now and relies
  on having /usr/local/share/Resurrection/fonts/ttf/VeraMono.ttf in place. The
  font is included in the distribution (I need to check its copyrights for
  proper distribution policy)

resurrection-beta-0.0.18.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- fixes a couple of small bugs
- improving UTF-8 support - testers needed :)
- started bringing back support for truetype vector fonts using freetype2

resurrection-beta-0.0.14.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- implemented more color-related control sequences. Let's hope Maff gets his
  irssi colors now. ;)

resurrection-beta-0.0.13.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- fixed a typo that broke background colors

resurrection-beta-0.0.12.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- added support for xterm 256-color mode

resurrection-beta-0.0.11.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- fixed 16-color support as Maff pointed out Irssi colors didn't work

resurrection-beta-0.0.10.tar.gz
-------------------------------
- fixed some draw bugs and other things related to copy-paste

resurrection-beta-0.0.9.tar.gz
------------------------------
- Rterm is worth trying, Rwm is quite early - only for the adventurous

R-alpha13.tar.gz
----------------

- some additions for MALLOC_TRACE.
- fixed at least one bug concerning valgrind-support.

R-alpha12.tar.gz
----------------

- MALLOC_TRACE enabled, can now trace actively allocated blocks (I'm not doing
  this for mapped regions though, the interface is so simple it shouldn't be
  necessary to debug it much. :) Besides, chances are I have enough
  book-keeping for mapped regions already. Oh, by the way, this tracing stuff
  is, at the moment, yet another feature that will be hostile to 64-bit
  systems... =)

R-alpha11.tar.gz
----------------

- getting really excited about valgrind. added initial support for it into the
  memory allocator. fixed a few minor nuisances mostly, and will look into the
  rest - the ones that actually ARE my fault - soon. :)
- readability cleanups in the allocator.

R-alpha10.tar.gz
----------------

- finally looked into valgrind, and with its guidance
	- fixed a mistake where I was allocating a window structure directly
	  with calloc() instead of using R_alloc_object().
	- found something that looks like a problem in the test-kludges; I'll
	  really look into this if it turns out to be something not related to
	  these KLUDGES that aren't supposed to be there to start with. >:)
- fixed window manager frame windows to have pointers to static event handler
  tables   instead of separately allocated tables of the same pointers for
  each. Should hopefully save a bit of memory and more importantly, make the wm
  run a bit faster. :)
- hacked some other minor stuff.

R-alpha9.tar.gz
---------------

- I don't think there's anything new worth mentioning or I forgot. :)

R-alpha8.tar.gz
---------------

- simple allocator benchmark; try
	cd lib/rc/malloc
	./prof.sh

R-alpha7.tar.gz
---------------

- swishy was the only one to get this. :)

R-alpha6.tar.gz
---------------

- never released to the outside world

R-alpha5.tar.gz
---------------

- never released to the outside world

R-alpha4.tar.gz
---------------

- a bug I had introduced to valloc() fixed.
- allocator cleanups, should be (almost? :) human-readable now. note that this
  means there are no statistics routines at the moment, but I'll redo them.
- a few more compiler warnings fixed.
- window manager menu images are now cached more properly for the situation.
  instead of allocating image objects for all menu items, i set pointers to
  cached internal copies.

NOTES
-----

You need Imlib2 to build and try this stuff. Other than that, you shouldn't
need anything but base X11 libraries.

The split of lib/Rwm/ into files sucks. :) Some functions are scattered over in
wrong files and so on. I will fix this later.

There's some stuff for the configure script in m4/. The file-split could, once
again, be better, but I hope some of this will be useful for some.

My new memory allocator is in lib/malloc - it's very simple and not complete
yet, but I'd think it should be fast. :)

There's a tiny bit of Unix porting utilities in include/Resurrection/port.h.
This, together with the macros under m4/, will attempt to mask some differences
between different Unix-like systems 

TESTING
-------

Prepare and build with

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

Alternatively, you can try

	./autogen.sh --help

to learn about autogen options.

There will be a couple of executables in the test/-directory. The one of your
interest is wmtest:

	cd test
	./wmtest &

The menu and pager (the two bars at topleft) don't have labels yet, but try
them; move on top of them.

The following keybindings should work when the wmtest window has keyboard
focus (you can focus by clicking on it):

	ctrl-shift-q	- quit (shows memory allocation statistics)
	shift-f1..f4	- desktop 1..4
	alt-f1..f3	- rxvt, emacs, firefox
