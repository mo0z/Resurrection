TODO
----

- make the allocator do a scan of malloc_hdrs for adjacent free chunks at top
  of heap to return to the system by sbrk(-n);. done already, try to verify if
  it actually works worth anything.
- make the allocator thread-safe.
- implement buffered I/O interface; fix lib/Resurrection/io.c.
- clean it all up. really? :P
- look into xine-lib to see how much hassle multimedia [playback] would be.
